      Zsh Setup for using zsh in its soruce directory
    ---------------------------------------------------

The .zshenv file contained within this repository can be used to run
zsh from within its source directory. This is achieved by creating a
local module directory followed by adjusting the module and function
search path variables.

To actually use the setup, adjust the $ZDOTDIR variable in the shell's
parent process's environment:

    % ZDOTDIR="$HOME/zsh-test" ./Src/zsh

The included .zshrc file is just an example. If you want to test
interactive features you probably want to make adjustments to that
file. The rest in that file is really just to increase convenience.

This setup is shipped under the same terms as Zsh itself:
